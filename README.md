# PYTHON-PROJECT-RESUME-GENERATOR
üìÑ Resume Generator using Streamlit
A web application that helps you quickly generate a professional resume from a simple form. This tool was built to simplify the resume creation process, allowing you to focus on the content without worrying about the formatting.

üöÄ **Overview**

This application provides a web-based form where users can enter their full name, contact information, work experience, skills, and other relevant details. Upon submission, the backend script uses the python-docx library to construct a Microsoft Word document and offers it as an immediate download.

‚öôÔ∏è**How It Works**
  1. The user interface is rendered using Streamlit.
  
  2. User fills out the resume form.
  
  3. On clicking "Generate Resume", the input data is passed to a Python function.
  
  4. The function uses python-docx to build a .docx file in memory.
  
  A download button is presented to the user to save the generated file.
